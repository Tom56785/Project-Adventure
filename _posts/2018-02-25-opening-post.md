Hello and welcome. This is my very first blog post on my new upcoming game. I have already detailed a little bit of information already about this project on the home page, so if you haven't read that then you can go there for some more information. These blogs will be showing my decisions throughout development and even show some code and me actually testing it out. As I've said on my home page the project is in a very, very young state; considering it is just me on my own the speed at which I will develop this game depends on how much time I'm able to give to this project. I plan to give a lot of attention to this project when I've got other things out of the way (probably summer time).

Anyway, I have got ideas on what this game might become. One thing that is clear is that the graphics and gameplay mechanics will be very similar to classic games such as Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion; one modern example being Thimbleweed Park. I love the classic style with the interface at the bottom and that also makes the graphics designing a little easier for me as well. The graphics engine is well into development already but not quite finished just yet. It is designed in OpenGL so that means it is cross-platform, it will run on both Windows and Linux. I like to develop on Linux so that is why I chose OpenGL as well as the obvious advantage of a wider audience. The language that the engine and the game are written in is C++ which is a very powerful language which I am pretty familiar with so it was an obvious choice to make the game in.

In terms of story, I don't have a plot at the moment or a specific setting but I have sketched out some scenes with some characters that I may include in the game. I do have a theme that I am basing my game from and that is Tarot cards; this could change should it prove too difficult but I doubt this will change. In terms of voice acting, I am currently considering including voices rather than just silent text and may even record many of the voices myself -- I wouldn't be doing all of the voices myself if I chose to do this but that would be fine by me.

That's all that I have for you at the moment. Stay tuned for more information.

Thanks for reading :)  
Tom
