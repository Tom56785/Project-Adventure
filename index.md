# [Development Blog](blog)

<br>
Hello and welcome to my development blog website. This is where I will be posting the latest and greatest information on my next project: a point-and-click adventure game. This project is something that I am undertaking alone but I will be keeping my source code for this project open-source; sharing is caring. This project will definitely take me a lot of time to make as I also have to make the graphics for it as well. I have even opted to create my own OpenGL graphics engine to challenge myself -- it might mean it takes longer to develop as a whole but will be worth the effort in the end.

You will find the blog by clicking the title above that reads, 'Development Blog'. Also on the right side of the screen (on computers) you will see various download links. There are downloads for the game binaries for both Windows and Linux (my game is cross-platform) and underneath you will find download links to the source code which can also be found on the GitHub page (link above). As of yet there aren't any binaries because development isn't at that stage just yet.

Thanks for reading :)  
Tom
